Multithreaded file server and logger - Martin Fennell - G00291266

This is the readme for my project for OOP

The program allows a client to connect to the server, print files to the console that the server contains, download files from the server and quit the application via a console window.

-first step is to run the program you can do this by running the program in eclipse console or by using the jar file in src directory with the command 

-second step is to follow the on screen commands to user the project
  

Note: the project is only parsing the xml file so far and making a connection between the client and server but unfortunatly the rest of the tasks are not working
